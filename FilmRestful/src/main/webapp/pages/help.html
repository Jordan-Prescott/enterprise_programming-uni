		<h1>Help Page</h1>
		<p>This page provides detailed information about this web
			application. Details on all features and step by step instructions on
			how to achieve a task can all be found in here. The structure of this
			help page is page first and then each feature beneath for example if
			you wanted to look for details on the search function you would first
			locate Main Page as this is the page its located on and then look for
			search.</p>
		<p>There is a table of content you can use to click to the
			relevant page you are looking for.</p>

		<!-- Table of contents -->
		<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#MainPage">Main Page</a></li>
			<li><a href="#AddPage">Add Film Page</a></li>
			<li><a href="#Help">Update Film Page</a></li>

		</ul>

		<h3>NOTE: Format</h3>
		<p>On the home, add film, and update page there is a format selection near the top right of each page.
		In the selection you have JSON, XML, and TEXT this is the how the data will be formatted/ requested in 
		each action on that page. For example if you are adding a page and select XML this will format your 
		film in XML when sending to the API. If you are selected TEXT when searching films on the main 
		page the films returned from the API will be in this format, parsed and then displayed in the 
		films table.</p>

		<!-- Main Page -->
		<h2 id="MainPage">Main Page</h2>
		<p>The main page is where all films in the database are presented
			in a table and where you access all features of this application.
			This is a simple page with a navigation bar across the top and the
			films table in the body.</p>

		<!-- Nav Bar -->
		<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
		<p>The navigation is to help you navigate around the application
			as well as hosting a couple other features such as notifications and
			search. This bar contains a home button of 'Film DB' a link to this
			help page, notifications section and the search function on the
			right-hand side.</p>
	
		<!-- Add Film -->
		<h4>Add Film</h4>
		<p>This button will take you to a new page where you can add films to the collection!</p>
			
		<h4>Can't Decide?</h4>
		<p>Looking for a film to watch and can't decide? Make the decision making easy 
		and let us choose a film for you! We will give you a random film for you to watch.
		If you have seen the film we pick for you click the button and we will pick again 
		until we find you one!.</p>

		<!-- Help -->
		<h4 id="Help">Help</h4>
		<p>You have already found your way here! This button will bring
			you to this page which as you can see details this web application.</p>

		<!-- Notification Bar -->
		<h4>Notifications</h4>
		<p>The notification bell is where all actions and notifications
			are shown. For example when you delete a film the message back from
			the API will be displayed here indicating if this was a success or if
			there was an error.</p>

		<!-- Search -->
		<h4>Search</h4>
		<p>The search function has two fields, the first being the format
			field where the user can specify the data format they prefer to
			receive the search results in. The available options are JSON, XML,
			or TEXT. The second field is the search field, where the user can
			enter the type of value they are searching for. The available options
			in this field are Title, Year, Director, Stars, Genre, and Rating.
			The search function uses these two fields to retrieve search results
			that match the user's query criteria in the specified format.</p>

		<p>The search input is dynamic and will update the table live as
			you type. This searches for what you type across the whole of the database 
			rather than a specific field. The intended use here is before
			hitting search and narrowing your search down to a field this will
			show you every instance your search appears in case you do not know
			which field exactly to search for. The data returned can be too much
			in some searches so please use the search button to narrow your
			search for cleaner results.</p>

		<!-- Body -->
		<h3>Body</h3>
		<p>The body is where the details of the films are shown in a table
			with features for the user to interact with the table.</p>
	
		<!-- Film Table -->
		<h4>Table</h4>
		<p>The table displays a list of film entries, each row
			representing a separate film, with columns for title, director,
			genre, year of release, and rating. In addition, each row contains
			two buttons: an "Update" button and a "Delete" button. The "Update"
			button allows the user to modify the details of a particular film,
			while the "Delete" button allows them to remove the film from the
			list entirely.</p>

		<!-- Film Table Buttons -->
		<h4>Update</h4>
		<p>The update button will take the user to another page where they
			are will be able to modify the details of a particular film</p>

		<h4>Delete</h4>
		<p>The delete button allows a user to remove the film from the
			list entirely. The user will be prompted to confirm they want to
			remove the film.</p>

		<!-- Add Page -->
		<h2 id="AddPage">Add Film Page</h2>
		<p>The page allows users to fill out a form to add a new film to
			the database. The form may contain fields such as title, director,
			genre, year of release, rating, and review, with each field requiring
			input from the user. Once the user has entered all the required
			information, they can submit the form to add the film to the
			database. The page may include features such as error checking to
			ensure that the user has entered all necessary information, as well
			as options to cancel or reset the form. The page requires all fields
			are filled in before the form is submitted.</p>

		<!-- Update Page -->
		<h2 id="UpdatePage">Update Film Page</h2>
		<p>The page allows the user to update a film by filling out a form
			with the film's current details pre-filled. The form will have fields
			for the film's title, director, genre, year of release, rating, and
			review, which the user can update as desired. Before the form can be
			processed, the user must fill in each field with new information or
			the current information if no update is required. The page requires
			all fields are filled in before the form is submitted.</p>

		<!-- API Page -->
		<h2 id="API">API Page</h2>
		<p>The page provides a comprehensive overview of the API for a
			film database. It includes information on all the available API
			requests, with an example of either body or response. This page is a
			brief overview but provides a inks to complete documentation.</p>

		<p>To help developers test and experiment with the API, the page
			includes a link to Postman, a popular development environment for
			making API calls. Users can simply click the link to open the
			relevant collection or workspace in Postman, pre-populated with the
			necessary API requests and parameters. This makes it easy for
			developers to quickly get up and running with the API and start
			building their applications. The page may be styled with CSS to make
			it visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
